## The Problem

My school was emailing all of its students <strong>everyone's</strong> exam seating arrangements in a big Excel file. It was quite bothersome for everyone to find their own information. Most people checked their seating arrangements on their phones hurriedly at the last minute just before every exam. The process was:

1. Open your email client.
1. Find that one email burried somewhere which contains the said Excel file.
1. Most people were manually scrolling and searching through this big Excel file for the relevant information because they were not aware of the Search functionality of their Excel viewer.

A small smartphone screen plus a dense Excel sheet is not an enjoyable experience especially when you are already worried about your exam.

## The Solution

I had the rough idea to circulate a python executable which would fetch the required data for the student from their emails. When I discussed the idea with a friend of mine, he suggested that a static website where everyone can search for their arrangements will be a better solution and I agreed but I knew almost nothing about making websites at the time. So this friend encouraged and helped me a lot as this was one of my first times writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The end result was a trimmed, formatted, smartphone-friendly, and easy-to-access representation of the required information by entering the university registration number in a simple search box.
